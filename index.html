      <h2>Travel Plans</h2>
      <p>Once the pandemic is over I'd love to travel. This is what I have in mind:<br>
         I am looking for mountains and sunshine. A country with English-speakers so I can communicate easily. Beaches would also do the trick.</p>
         <ul><li>AUSTRALIA</li>
            <article>Over the years I have only heard good things about Australia. One of my friends lived there for about a year and loved it. When I asked her about her experience this is what she had to say:<br></article>
               <div id="quote"><p>&quot;My trip to Australia was probably the best year of my life! It was hard being away from family but I had so much fun. I met wonderful people that I am still in touch with today but mostly I met Tony, my husband!<br>
               I also got my 1st tattoo! Honestly Australia was the BEST and I loved every second of it!&quot;</div>
            <li>NEW ZEALAND</li>
            <article>Don't want to get too clich√© but Lord of the Rings, everyone? Do you remember the gorgeous landscapes as they were walking to the Mordor? So pretty and wild. Obviously I am not expecting to 
               meet Hobbits and Orcs... I want to understand Maori culture a little and would love to hike some of those gorgeous mountains.<br>
            </article>
            <li>CANADA</li>
            <article>How about Vancouver? It is a lot closer so tickets would be cheaper. This is what I found from Tripsavvy.com.<br>
               <em>One of the most famous things about Vancouver is its physical beauty. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains and deep blue sea, Vancouver is gorgeous; when the sun is shining, it's truly a sight to behold. Its beauty is so famous, Vancouver has made multiple lists of "Most Beautiful Cities in the World," including Forbes' list and Buzzfeed's. 
               If you're visiting Vancouver, you can enjoy the scenery on a boat tour or sightseeing cruise, from one of Vancouver's best viewpoints, or while you dine at one of Vancouver's restaurants with a view.</em></article></ul></p>

     <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">$$MONEY$$<br>
      More money, less problems. Aaahhh the thoughts of being rich!<br> 
      How about spend less, save more? I already do that...<br>Maybe I could play the lottery and give it a shot. I wonder how much I'll lose until I hit the JACKPOT?! &#128527;<br>
      Mmhh I guess earning more is where it's at. Ok! I got this figured out! Earn more is the plan.<br>Can't wait to be independently wealthy! I may not even have to choose between 3 travel destinations afterall.  &#128526;</p>

     <h2>Professional Plans</h2>
     <p>Learn how to code with<a href="https://learn.launchcode.org/" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a>.<br>I should also get a<a href="https://www.acfe.com/become-cfe-qualifications.aspx" target="_blank">CFE certification</a>.
      Let's add<a href="https://www.learnpython.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>and<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql" target="_blank">SQL</a>to that list.<br><br>
      It'd also be nice to dust off my Spanish.<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/es/en/Learn-Spanish" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>has the answer for that!</p>

     <h2>More Pets!</h2>
     <p>It would be wonderful to get more pets. I don't know about<em>all</em>of these but maybe an other cat and a dog. My top 2 favorite dog breeds are Australian Shepherds and Golden Retrievers.
      They are high energy and do require lots of space but these breeds are so smart and make for such amazing dogs. I'd rather they not be pure breeds - so long as they retain most of the traits of the breed, it works for me!<br>
      If I could get another cat I'd prefer a short-haired one. I currently have a long hair cat (Siamese X Main Coon) and the amount of hair around the house is out of this world. While Main Coons are gorgeous I think
      that a cute gray cat with piercing green eyes would be perfection!<br></p>
